This file is to track the open TODO's and their dependencies for the implementation of the event design.

Important
- Finish the Integration Test in AllHandlersIT
- Finish RemoteSituationDetection: Unit-Tests and Implementation
- Change DB-Calls to IMetaDataStorage
- Refactor Interface of RemoteSituationDetection to get the full instead of the ObjectId, this is needed because for a remote-deletion there is no valid Id left but it is clear that a deletion happened.
- Implement MetaDataStorage

NiceToHave Refactorings:
- Tear apart Watcher: EventProducer and EventHandler in seperate classes.
